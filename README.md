# Eddie Brett WEBSITE

I want to create a dynamics, clean, user friendly website where users can navigate through a webstore, blogs and music etc with minimal clicks. This is not a corparate website and i do not want it to feel like one, nor is it a sight that will reguarly needs up dating, with that in mind i dont want to other complicate information but i want it to be easy for adminastrative users to update or add information.
 
## UX
 
The users will want to find our website from google, which is why we've added meta tags to all of our pages. 
Users will want to know what Eddie is up to, and so we will include a blog section field with easy to update stories.
Users might want to know who Eddie is and so we will include videos and work that he has previously done.
User will want to buy merchandise and so we will make an online store.
Users may wish to contact Eddie so we will include a contact form.
Users will want to get a general sense of what Eddie Brett is about and so we will make sure all styling and written represents that of an approachable, humorous street poet from east london.

## Features

The home page is the first page that visitor will see and so i have place a recognisable picture used as the artwork for his first release. I have tried to make the text included thorough and informative whilst remaining entertaining and necessary. I was cautious to not waffle on, repeat anything and become boring. Anyone wanting to know who mate is will find out here.

I wanted the music page to feel like a collage. A varied mixture of the different things that Eddie has worked on. This page can easily grow and adapt as more work becomes available. Users wanting to see material are presented with various music and video options.

The merch page is more-or-less a blank page at the moment. It exists to let people know that there will be merchandise avaiable soon so to keep checking.

The collab page is very matter of fact. Not busy with infomation just a very clear box and oportunity for users to connect with the project if they want. Users wanting to contact mate can do so here and i have attached the managers email to the email-box.

 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Once the project is in full swing and mate is touring we will also create a new page called 'touring' a gig type poster designed in photoshop to relay all of the information regarding gig dates and upcoming shows.

## Technologies Used

I've used the bootstrap framework https://getbootstrap.com/ because of its ease of use and clear layouts. I have used google fonts https://fonts.google.com/ to give my site some interesting asthetically pleasing fonts that tie in well with the brand. I have embedded youtube iFrames in my site because they are a fantastic video player and the format is known to the user degraphic. I have made my site with HTML5 and CSS. I have used a custom domaine name purchased from Go daddy. www.godaddy.com

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

I tested the code using the mark up validation website https://validator.w3.org/ and addressed any errors it picked up. I used the google chrome inspect tool to check the functionality on various devices. I got friends to test the site on their devices in order to get some honest feedback on the ease of use and to pick up any problems i had over looked. I clicked on every hyperlink to ensure that i arrived at the correct destination. I clicked play on all of the videos to make sure they played and that they displayed the correct content.

Using mobile first design was a great way to ensure that the site was asthetically pleasing across all devices.

I sent test emails to the email address provided in the contact page to ensure that that feature was working.


1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.



## Deployment

When i have made a change to my website i deploy the update to GitHub. This website is simple in nature and so only requires one branch called the master and everything is uploaded there. When i have made a change that i want to upload i type in the terminal: 'git init' Then i add the file i have updated for exaple: 'git add readme.md' I then add a note of what has been updated and commit the files staged in the local repository: 'git commit -m "updated readme file to be more specific and include UX drawings"' and then finally: 'git push -u origin master' This pushes the changes in the local repository to github.
